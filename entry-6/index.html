      <h2 id="first">Moon Method</h2>
      <p>The Last Quarter, or Third Quarter, Moon is in the phase where the lunar body is lit at 50 percent on the left side of the Moon. This is a cycle that can be quite empowering, as we are letting go and releasing all of the things that we want to get rid of from the Full Moon</p>
      <p>
        Scientifically: After a full moon, the moon starts becoming less illuminated again, waning toward the last quarter moon. Spiritually: The themes surrounding this phase of the moon are gratitude, generosity, and enthusiasm. You should be feeling the benefits of your hard work for the last two weeks.</p>
      <h2 id="second">Final Quarter</h2>
      <p>The Waning (shrinking) Gibbous Moon rises after sunset, transits the meridian after midnight and sets after sunrise. The waning gibbous phase repeats every 29.531 days -one synodic month. The Moon's motion around the Earth, with the Sun illuminating only one side of the Earth and Moon. As the illuminated side of the moon appears to be getting smaller in size (after a full moon), the moon is said to be in a “waning phase”. The moon for the next 7 days will be in a “waning gibbous phase”.</p>
      <p>The Waning Gibbous phase of the Moon is the perfect time in the month to be grateful and share the right thing you have in life with the loved ones. The light of the Moon is starting to decrease until a New Moon, and it means you can now benefit from the hard work you had to do for the last two weeks. The Full Moon begins to decrease slowly and enter the Waning Gibbous phase. This is a time of weed cutting and ultimately, complete detachment. We took the time to carefully consider what we will no longer allow to be present in our lives, now we are taking action.</p>
      <h2 id="third">Moon Affirmation</h2>
      <p>The keywords here are discernment & action. Make a list if you need to, talk to a loved one, talk to yourself. What is truly holding you back from success? What are you holding onto out of familiarity or convenience? This is also a time in which we may be experiencing more revelations than normal in regards to things that may need to be released that we were not aware of PREVIOUSLY.</p>
      <p><li>I release what serves my past & make room for what serves my future</li>
         <li>I am safe & supported in my decision making</li>
         <li>I remain grateful for all that I have learned, achieved, & accumulated thus far</li></p>
