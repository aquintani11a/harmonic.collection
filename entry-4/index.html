       <h1>September 27th WAXING GIBBOUS</h1>

       <p>The Waxing Gibbous phase is one of the secondary phases of the Moon. The Waxing Gibbous is an intermediate phase of the Moon that starts right after the First Quarter when the illumination is 50%. The name Gibbous comes from the Moon's shape, which is less than a Full Moon but more extensive than the Third Quarter's semicircle shape.</p>
       <p>The Waxing Gibbous Moon symbolizes the final steps you have to make to finish your work, the final stages of your project. It is the time when you can see the light from the end of the tunnel, but also the time for the final stretch and sprint to finish what you have started until the Full Moon so that you could enjoy the satisfaction of your hard work.</p>
       <p>Under the Waxing Gibbous Moon, you can feel the urge to change the direction of your life or your project. It is important not to resist this feeling. Instead of fighting, embrace it and trust it because only good things will happen if you do so. Some sacrifices will likely be needed to benefit from the reevaluation.</p>
       <p>In the Waxing Gibbous phase, most of the Moon is visible from Earth, its illumination increasing every night until the Full Moon. On the other hand, the Waning Gibbous phase is when the Moon's light starts to wane, and the surface we can see is steadily shrinking until it reaches the Last Quarter phase.</p>
       <p>The waxing gibbous phase signals redirection, adjustment, and flexibility. Your plans are being challenged, and your patience is being tested. During this phase, it's important to expend your energy to honor the cycle of movement and expansion.</p>
