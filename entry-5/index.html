      <h2 id="first">Moon Method</h2>
      <p>Moon impacts on life: time, tides and light. 'For many animals, particularly birds, the Moon is essential to migration and navigation. Other will time their reproduction to coincide with the specific phases of the lunar cycle. There is also a whole world of fascinating adaptations relating to tides and the unique properties of moonlight. The reason I chose to talk about the Moon is to learn more about these ideas of the Moon and also try to share the knowledge.</p>
      <p>Fluctuating light levels reflected by the Moon also have a startling impact on life on Earth. Not only has low lighting led to a number of interesting nocturnal adaptations, but some organisms rely directly on moonlight to navigate and procreate.</p>
      <h2 id="second">Waning Gibbous</h2>
      <p>The Waning (shrinking) Gibbous Moon rises after sunset, transits the meridian after midnight and sets after sunrise. The waning gibbous phase repeats every 29.531 days -one synodic month. The Moon's motion around the Earth, with the Sun illuminating only one side of the Earth and Moon. As the illuminated side of the moon appears to be getting smaller in size (after a full moon), the moon is said to be in a “waning phase”. The moon for the next 7 days will be in a “waning gibbous phase”.</p>
      <p>The Waning Gibbous phase of the Moon is the perfect time in the month to be grateful and share the right thing you have in life with the loved ones. The light of the Moon is starting to decrease until a New Moon, and it means you can now benefit from the hard work you had to do for the last two weeks.</p>
