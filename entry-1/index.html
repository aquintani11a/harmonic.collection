		<h1>September 13th WANING GIBBOUS</h1>
		<p>After the full moon the light continuously decreases
            and shadows begin to grow. This is the Waning Gibbous phase. You 
            can see most of this phase at night and early morning. 
        </p>
		<p>The waning moon is a good time to RENEW, WITHDRAW, and REST. Use this time 
            to get rid of bad habits, stresses and any negative thinking you have been 
            experiencing.
