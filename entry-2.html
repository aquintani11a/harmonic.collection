		<h1>September 19th WANING CRESCENT</h1>
		<p>Sometimes referred to as the "old moon". It a wise and good aged moon 
            that has already experienced every phase in the cycle. As the light of the 
            Moon wanes, energy is slowing down and bathing us in feeling of gratitude and 
            saitation. 
        </p>
		<p>The waning crescent moon invites you to release clutter and create 
            a sacred place to dwell in to allow you mind and energy to feel clear. 
            A ritual for this moon would be to clutter cleanse. Out with the old and 
            highly recommend thinking hard about letting in the new for a while.
