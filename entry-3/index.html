       <h1>September 27th WAXING CRESCENT</h1>
     </header>
     
     <main>
       <p>This phase is called the Waxing Crescent because the area illuminated on the surface of the Moon makes the shape of a crescent, and the term waxing means increasing. This phase is one step in the cycle away from the First Quarter phase, so the angle of the Earth, Moon, and Sun is almost perpendicular.</p>
       <p>If our bodies and minds recharged under a New Moon, the Waxing Crescent phase is the proper time to set new intentions with added energy and light. As the Sun is starting to increase its illumination over the Moon, our energy is growing as well. It is time to be thankful to the Universe in advance and visualize your plans for the next month.</p>
       <p>'Waxing' means that the illuminated portion of the Moon is increasing. In the waxing crescent phase, only a crescent-shaped sliver is visible to us. What this means for you. After relaxing, recharging, and reflecting in the New Moon, you're ready to go forth with new light and added energy.</p>
