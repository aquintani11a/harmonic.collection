      <h2 id="first">Moon Method</h2>
      <p>Moon impacts on life: time, tides and light. 'For many animals, particularly birds, the Moon is essential to migration and navigation. Other will time their reproduction to coincide with the specific phases of the lunar cycle. There is also a whole world of fascinating adaptations relating to tides and the unique properties of moonlight. The reason I chose to talk about the Moon is to learn more about these ideas of the Moon and also try to share the knowledge.</p>
      <p>Fluctuating light levels reflected by the Moon also have a startling impact on life on Earth. Not only has low lighting led to a number of interesting nocturnal adaptations, but some organisms rely directly on moonlight to navigate and procreate.</p>
      <h2 id="second">Waning Crescent</h2>
      <p>The Waning Crescent Moon rises after sunset, transits the meridian after midnight and sets after sunrise. The waning gibbous phase repeats every 29.531 days -one synodic month. The Moon's motion around the Earth, with the Sun illuminating only one side of the Earth and Moon. As the illuminated side of the moon appears to be getting smaller in size (after a full moon), the moon is said to be in a “waning phase”. The moon for the next 7 days will be in a “waning gibbous phase”.</p>
      <p>The Waning Crescent phase of the Moon is the perfect time in the month to be grateful and share the right thing you have in life with the loved ones. The light of the Moon is starting to decrease until a New Moon, and it means you can now benefit from the hard work you had to do for the last two weeks. The Full Moon begins to decrease slowly and enter the Waning Gibbous phase. This is a time of weed cutting and ultimately, complete detachment. We took the time to carefully consider what we will no longer allow to be present in our lives, now we are taking action.</p>
      <h2 id="third">Moon Affirmation</h2>
      <p>The keywords here are discernment & action. Make a list if you need to, talk to a loved one, talk to yourself. What is truly holding you back from success? What are you holding onto out of familiarity or convenience? This is also a time in which we may be experiencing more revelations than normal in regards to things that may need to be released that we were not aware of PREVIOUSLY.</p>
      <p><li>I release what serves my past & make room for what serves my future</li>
         <li>I am safe & supported in my decision making</li>
         <li>I remain grateful for all that I have learned, achieved, & accumulated thus far</li></p>
